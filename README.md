###### ItemStackRecipeProject

A **Spigot** plugin wrote in **Kotlin**.

This plugin demonstrates the use of the **PrepareItemCraftEvent** to craft an item.  Crafting via this event allows for 
the recipe to require custom items.  Which is not available via the ShapelessRecipe and ShapedRecipe methods.

Tested on Spigot 1.14.1 API and Kotlin 1.3.3.
